Use as you like. Give credit if you feel like it.

Made for a game jam I did not complete. Tried making everything as modular as possible (not perfectly though). Most game parameters can be changed easily by changing the variable values.


Includes:

Dash, 2, 4 or 8 directional.

Double jump.

Wall jump, with different behaviour if close to a ledge or not.

Corner correction, jump, dash and edge save.

Coyote time (including wall jump).

Dash init pause.

Halved gravity jump peak.

Jump buffering (including wall jump).

Wall latching pause.

etc.
